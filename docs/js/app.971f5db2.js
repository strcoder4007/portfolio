They work. They save people time. They’re useful. But after doing this long enough, I’ve realized something most people in the hype cycle don’t talk about: <b>fully autonomous agents aren’t even close to production-ready.</b><br><br><b>The Industry’s New Obsession</b><br><br>Everywhere you look, someone’s calling 2025 “the year of AI agents.” Startups are pitching “autonomous coworkers.” Enterprise decks promise “self-driving workflows.” Meanwhile, my team’s been heads down actually building these systems — not prototypes, but production code. Here’s what that looked like: Dev tools: agents that turn text prompts into React components, refactor old code, and keep API docs up to date. Infra & data ops: systems that run database migrations, handle Terraform generation, and fix deployment scripts. Automation: AI that writes test cases, opens PRs, and suggests bug fixes. They’ve all been useful. But they’ve also exposed how fragile the “fully autonomous” dream really is.<br><br><b>The Three Things I’ve Learned (the Hard Way)</b><br><br>After hundreds of experiments, three lessons keep coming up: 1. <b>Error rates explode with every added step.</b> Even 95% reliability per step turns into 36% success after 20 steps. Production needs 99.9%+. 2. <b>Conversations don’t scale economically.</b> Context windows balloon costs fast — a 100-turn chat can quietly rack up $50–100 in API calls. 3. <b>Most failures aren’t “AI” problems — they’re design problems.</b> The real skill lies in how you design the tools, not how smart the model is.<br><br><b>Why Long Agent Workflows Break Down</b><br><br>Here’s the math no one in marketing decks wants to show: if your agent workflow has ten steps at 95% accuracy each, you’re already down to a 59% success rate. By twenty steps, you’re closer to a coin toss. Even 99% accuracy per step isn’t enough — you’d still fail one in five times. That’s why my DevOps agent works: it’s short and structured. It doesn’t try to “own” the whole workflow. It runs a few isolated operations — each independently verifiable — and then asks for a human confirmation before moving forward. That’s not just good engineering; it’s the only way the math makes sense.<br><br><b>The Hidden Cost No One Talks About</b><br><br>Another reality check: <b>long conversations cost real money.</b> Every new message reprocesses the old ones. That means costs scale with the square of the conversation length. When I built a conversational database agent, the first few interactions were cheap. By the 50th query, the token bill was ridiculous — several dollars per response. At scale, that’s unsustainable. The solution? Don’t make everything conversational. My best-performing systems are <b>stateless</b>. They take input, perform one clear task, and stop. No history, no ballooning context, no silent cost creep.<br><br><b>The Part Everyone Underestimates: Tool Design</b><br><br>Tool design is where most AI projects quietly fail. When an agent runs a tool, it needs structured, minimal feedback — just enough to decide what to do next, without blowing up its context. For example, when my database agent runs a query, it doesn’t dump 10,000 rows into the model. It sends back: <i>{status: \\"success\\", results_count: 10000, preview: [...]}</i>. That one change made it ten times more reliable. Designing tools that communicate like that is a skill — one that sits halfway between backend engineering and prompt design. It’s slow, unglamorous work, but it’s what separates real production systems from fancy demos.<br><br><b>Integration: The Graveyard of Agent Demos</b><br><br>Even if your agent logic is perfect, the real world is messy. APIs fail. Auth tokens expire. Rate limits change. Legacy systems don’t behave the same way twice. My database agent isn’t just “autonomously running queries.” It manages connection pools, retries failed transactions, and logs everything for audits. That’s not “AI” — that’s just software engineering. When startups say “our agent integrates with your whole stack,” I usually translate that as: <i>it works until something goes slightly wrong.</i><br><br><b>What’s Actually Working in Production</b><br><br>After a year of testing, here’s what consistently holds up: UI agents work when humans review outputs before shipping. Database agents work when they confirm destructive operations. Function generators work when they stay stateless. Infra automation works when it outputs code (like Terraform) that can be reviewed and rolled back. CI/CD agents work when each step has clear success metrics and recovery paths. Notice the pattern? AI handles the complexity. Humans maintain control. Software engineering ensures reliability.<br><br><b>My 2025 Prediction: Who Thrives, Who Crashes</b><br><br>Here’s how I see the next year playing out: the “fully autonomous” startups will hit reliability and cost walls fast. Their 5-step demos won’t survive real-world 20-step workflows. Big enterprise add-ons — the “AI agent” tab bolted onto existing tools — will stagnate. They’ll fail to integrate deeply enough to matter. Winners will be the teams building narrow, domain-specific systems that use AI where it helps and code where it counts. In other words, the future belongs to <b>smart assistants</b>, not <b>autonomous coworkers</b>.<br><br><b>Thinking About Building One? Start Here.</b><br><br>If you’re building or integrating AI agents, these are the guardrails that keep things sane: 1. Keep the scope tight. Make it great at one thing, not ten. 2. Expect failure. Design recovery paths early. 3. Watch your costs. Stateless often wins. 4. Favor reliability over magic. Users don’t care how “autonomous” it feels — they care that it works every time. 5. Marry AI with solid engineering. Let the model handle language and reasoning, but rely on code for state, validation, and control. Autonomy is overrated. Consistency is underrated.<br><br><b>From Someone Who’s Been There</b><br><br>The gap between a great demo and a stable production system is enormous — and it’s where most of the real engineering happens. If you’re working on similar challenges, I’d love to chat. I’ve helped teams figure out why their agents aren’t scaling, debug weird failure loops, and rethink architectures that weren’t built for reliability. There’s no magic formula here — just careful engineering, iteration, and a willingness to admit what doesn’t work. The future of AI agents is coming, but it’s going to look a lot more practical — and a lot more human — than the hype suggests.</p>","time":"16 October 2025","tags":["reading","agents","genai"]},{"title":"Beliefs that make products better","content":"<p>Shipping beats perfect strategy. Speed is a superpower. I believe shipping quickly is the most reliable way to learn what actually matters — small teams iterate faster, make cleaner trade-offs, and move in ways big orgs can’t. Build a bias toward shipping: get something out, watch how people use it, then improve. Focus on product adoption — real people using what you built — not just launch-day demos.<br><br>Make speed deliberate. Ship small, measure, tell customers what changed, then repeat. Landing features (real adoption) matters more than launching features (releasing code). If you’re not willing to change how you work, you’ll be outpaced by teams that are — especially AI-native teams that treat models and data as part of the product loop.<br><br>Grit matters more than raw talent. There’s no substitute for the hours you put in. Small, steady improvements beat flashy talent. Try to be 1% better each day. Be ruthlessly truth-seeking — the truth can sting, and that’s fine. Change your mind when evidence points the other way. Have strong opinions, loosely held.<br><br>Collective truth beats anecdata. Anecdotes are useful, but don’t confuse them with insight. Seek the collective signal, not the single loud voice. At the same time, don’t freeze waiting for perfect data — use what you have and iterate.<br><br>Communication is the job. Clear writing equals clear thinking. Everyone needs to get better at writing — yes, you included. Leaders provide clarity when it’s missing. Be the person who takes notes, even if they’re just for you. Mismatched expectations cause pain; anticipate objections before you hit send and answer them.<br><br>Teach more than you pitch. Education is the best developer marketing. Be authentic, own your failures, and be helpful — small acts compound. Don’t hide behind fancy event names; be real and useful.<br><br>Lead by doing and by influence. Leadership is owning outcomes beyond org charts. Influence > titles. Great leaders hire well: hire for growth potential over current skills. There are two hiring answers: “hell yes” or “no.” Hire people you’ll learn from and folks you’d be happy working with. My favorite interview question: what work are you most proud of?<br><br>Work can be a hobby — but set boundaries. Passion matters, but so do limits. Your best work comes from curiosity, not burnout. Demos beat memos: if you can prototype something in a meeting, do it. Only ship things you’d be excited to use yourself.<br><br>Finally: lead with empathy. Assume good intent. People have bad days.

This blog post delves into visualizing hidden layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch and Matplotlib, offering insights into the feature extraction process and model behavior.</p>\\n\\n<h3>1. Introduction</h3>\\n\\n<p>Deep CNNs have achieved exceptional performance in various computer vision tasks. However, their intricate architectures often obscure their decision-making processes. Visualizing the activations of hidden layers can illuminate the features and patterns learned by these networks, providing a clearer view of their functionality.</p>\\n\\n<h3>2. Data Collection and Processing</h3>\\n\\n<p>For this project, we utilized the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in the field of image classification. This dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). We chose MNIST due to its simplicity and the ease with which we can test our visualization techniques.</p>\\n\\n<p>The data was collected from the torchvision library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for loading and transforming datasets. We applied basic preprocessing, including normalization, to ensure the images were suitable for our CNN. Normalization helps in speeding up the training process and improving the model\'s performance.</p>\\n\\n<h3>3.

While the deeper CNN showed promise, it required more computational resources and tuning. Surprisingly, the pre-trained models offered valuable insights but were less effective in this context due to MNIST\'s simplicity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Evaluation was performed using the test set, measuring accuracy and loss. The basic CNN model showed good performance with an accuracy of around 98%, whereas the deeper CNN achieved marginally better accuracy but with increased training time.</p>\\n\\n<h3>8.

Interpreting the Visualizations</h3>\\n\\n<p>The visualizations show the feature maps from the first convolutional layer. Brighter areas indicate stronger activations, revealing where the network detects features. Typically, early layers capture simple features like edges and textures, while deeper layers identify complex patterns specific to the task.</p>\\n\\n<h3>10. Advanced Visualization Techniques</h3>\\n\\n<p>While basic visualizations are helpful, advanced techniques can offer deeper insights:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li><strong>Guided Backpropagation:</strong> Highlights which parts of the input image influence specific neuron activations.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM):</strong> Provides visual explanations for predictions by emphasizing important image regions.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Feature Inversion:</strong> Reconstructs the input image from feature representations, showing what information is preserved at each layer.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h3>11. Future Directions</h3>\\n\\n<p>If I were to revisit this project, I\'d explore more sophisticated models and techniques for visualization. For instance, experimenting with deeper architectures and different types of layers might yield better insights. Additionally, applying these techniques to more complex datasets could provide more nuanced understanding and improved model interpretability.</p>\\n\\n<h3>12. Conclusion</h3>\\n\\n<p>Visualizing hidden layers in neural networks is a powerful approach for enhancing model transparency and debugging. By peering into the network\'s inner workings, we gain valuable insights into its decision-making processes and can potentially identify areas for improvement. As deep learning continues to advance, techniques like these are crucial for developing more interpretable and effective artificial intelligence systems.</p>","time":"24 July 2024","tags":["Visualizing layer","Deep learning","Convolutional Neural Networks"]},{"title":"Need For Speed Self Driving Car","content":"<h3>Training a ConvNet to drive in Need for Speed: Most Wanted</h3>\\n\\n<p>After making the Mario Reinforcement Learning project my understanding about these systems became clearer and new project ideas started coming to mind. One project that I was amazed with was Sentdex (youtuber) GTA 5 self driving series. I first saw that series in 2016 and since then I wanted to train one of my own. But not GTA 5 but NFS Most Wanted.So, we\'ll explore how to train a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to play Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005).

We\'ll frame this as an image-to-action mapping problem: given a grayscale image of the game screen, our ConvNet needs to output the appropriate steering command.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\\n<p>The first step in any machine learning project is data acquisition. In this case, we need to play the game ourselves and record our actions. Here\'s a Python script that captures screen images and keyboard inputs:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>import numpy as np\\nimport cv2\\nfrom grabscreen import grab_screen\\nfrom getkeys import key_check\\n\\ndef keys_to_output(keys):\\n    output = [0,0,0]  # [A,W,D]\\n    if \'A\' in keys: output[0] = 1\\n    elif \'D\' in keys: output[2] = 1\\n    else: output[1] = 1\\n    return output\\n\\n# Main data collection loop\\nwhile True:\\n    screen = grab_screen(region=(0,40,800,640))\\n    screen = cv2.cvtColor(screen, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\\n    screen = cv2.resize(screen, (160,120))\\n    keys = key_check()\\n    output = keys_to_output(keys)\\n    training_data.append([screen,output])\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This script runs in the background while we play, continuously adding (state, action) pairs to our dataset.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>\\n<p>Once we have our raw data, we need to prepare it for training:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>X = np.array([i[0] for i in data]).reshape(-1, 120, 160, 1)\\ny = np.array([i[1] for i in data])\\nX = X / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<h3>Model Architecture</h3>\\n<p>For our ConvNet, we\'ll use a modified InceptionResNetV2 architecture.

Here are some key observations:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Data Imbalance</strong>: Our model had a strong bias towards driving straight, likely due to overrepresentation in the training data. This highlights the importance of balanced datasets in imitation learning.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Overfitting</strong>: The model showed signs of memorizing specific tracks rather than generalizing driving skills. This suggests we might need more diverse training data or stronger regularization.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Action Oscillation</strong>: Rapid switching between left and right turns led to a \\"wiggle\\" effect. This could potentially be mitigated by incorporating temporal information, perhaps through a recurrent architecture or frame stacking.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Computational Constraints</strong>: Running game emulation, screen capture, and neural network inference simultaneously pushed our hardware to its limits. This underscores the need for efficient, real-time inference in game-playing AI.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Dynamic Obstacle Handling</strong>: The model struggled with traffic and police cars, indicating a need for more sophisticated environment understanding.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Future Directions</h3>\\n<p>This project opens up several exciting avenues for further research:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Instead of imitation learning, we could frame this as a RL problem, allowing the agent to discover optimal driving strategies through trial and error.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Multi-Task Learning</strong>: We could extend our model to handle not just driving, but also higher-level tasks like race completion or police evasion.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Curriculum Learning</strong>: Starting with simple, traffic-free scenarios and gradually increasing complexity could lead to more robust agents.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Transfer Learning</strong>: Can driving skills learned in Need for Speed transfer to other racing games, or even to real-world autonomous driving simulations?</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>Training an AI to play Need for Speed: Most Wanted is more than just a fun project—it\'s a microcosm of the challenges we face in real-world autonomous driving.

This project serves as an excellent case study in the challenges and intricacies of training an agent to perform complex sequential decision-making tasks.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Problem Formulation</h3>\\n\\n<p>Our objective is to train an agent to navigate through levels of Super Mario Bros, maximizing its score while avoiding obstacles. We\'ll frame this as a reinforcement learning problem, where the agent must learn a policy that maps game states to actions, optimizing for long-term reward.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Environment Setup</h3>\\n\\n<p>We\'ll use OpenAI\'s Gym library along with a custom Super Mario Bros environment. Here\'s the basic setup:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>import gym\\nimport gym_super_mario_bros\\nfrom gym_super_mario_bros.actions import SIMPLE_MOVEMENT\\nfrom nes_py.wrappers import JoypadSpace\\n\\nenv = gym_super_mario_bros.make(\'SuperMarioBros-v0\')\\nenv = JoypadSpace(env, SIMPLE_MOVEMENT)\\n\\nstate_space = env.observation_space.shape[0]\\naction_space = env.action_space.n\\n\\nprint(f\\"State space: {state_space}\\")\\nprint(f\\"Action space: {action_space}\\")\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This setup provides us with a discrete action space and a high-dimensional state space (the raw pixel data of the game screen).</p>\\n\\n<h3>Model Architecture</h3>\\n\\n<p>For our agent, we\'ll implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The architecture is as follows:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>import torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\n\\nclass DQN(nn.Module):\\n    def __init__(self, state_space, action_space):\\n        super(DQN, self).__init__()\\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4)\\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2)\\n        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1)\\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3136, 512)\\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, action_space)\\n\\n    def forward(self, x):\\n        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))\\n        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))\\n        x = torch.relu(self.conv3(x))\\n        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)\\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))\\n        return self.fc2(x)\\n\\ndqn = DQN(state_space, action_space)\\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(dqn.parameters(), lr=0.00025)\\nloss_fn = nn.MSELoss()\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This architecture uses convolutional layers to process the visual input, followed by fully connected layers to produce Q-values for each action.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Training Algorithm</h3>\\n\\n<p>We\'ll use the DQN algorithm with experience replay and target network.

This sparse reward structure can make learning difficult, as the agent receives limited feedback on its actions. We might consider reward shaping to provide more frequent learning signals.</li>\\n    <li><strong>High-Dimensional State Space</strong>: Using raw pixel data as input results in a very large state space, which can slow down learning. Techniques like frame stacking or using a more compact state representation (e.g., Mario\'s position, velocity, and nearby obstacles) could potentially improve learning efficiency.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Partial Observability</strong>: The game screen provides only partial information about the game state. The agent cannot see what\'s coming ahead, which makes long-term planning challenging. This is a common issue in many real-world reinforcement learning problems.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Temporal Credit Assignment</strong>: Many actions in Mario have delayed effects (e.g., jumping to avoid an enemy you can\'t see yet). This makes it difficult for the agent to associate actions with their long-term consequences. Techniques like n-step returns or eligibility traces might help address this issue.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off</strong>: Balancing exploration of the environment with exploitation of known good strategies is crucial. The epsilon-greedy approach we\'ve used is a simple way to handle this, but more sophisticated methods like intrinsic motivation or parameter noise for exploration could potentially yield better results.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Future Directions</h3>\\n\\n<p>This project opens up several interesting avenues for further research:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Advanced Architectures</strong>: Experimenting with more sophisticated network architectures, such as dueling DQN or distributional DQN, could potentially improve performance.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Multi-task Learning</strong>: Training the agent to play multiple Mario levels or even different NES games could lead to more robust and general game-playing agents.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Meta-learning</strong>: Investigating meta-learning approaches to allow the agent to adapt quickly to new levels or game variations.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Implementing a hierarchical approach where high-level policies (e.g., \\"complete the level\\") are composed of lower-level policies (e.g., \\"jump over obstacle\\") could potentially handle the complexity of the game more effectively.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n\\n<p>Training an AI to play Super Mario Bros serves as an excellent case study in deep reinforcement learning. It encompasses many of the challenges we face in more complex, real-world applications of RL, such as robotics or autonomous driving. By tackling these problems in a controlled, simulated environment, we can gain valuable insights that may transfer to more practical applications.</p>\\n\\n<p>The code for this project is available on GitHub. I encourage readers to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and learning algorithms. There\'s still much to explore in the world of AI game-playing agents!</p>","time":"10 July 2024","tags":["mario","reinforcement learning"]},{"title":"The Essence of Engineering","content":"<p>I have been programming for the past six years—two and a half years in competitive programming and the rest in web development. While competitive programming felt like true engineering, web development, especially frontend, does not. Six years in, I aspire to be an engineer in the truest sense. As people venture to Mars, I\'m here centering text in a div. Both are labeled \\"Engineering,\\" but how can I equate my work to theirs? The difference in impact, skill, and excitement is stark, making me question if I\'m truly utilizing my potential. No matter how proficient I become in web development, I\'ll always feel my mind could be better applied to System Engineering or Machine Learning, tackling the truly challenging problems. Web development may seem filled with unsolvable tasks, but I disagree. At best, it\'s about novel ideas and doing something new within the browser.</p><p>At the end of the day, coding for the web isn\'t the bottleneck; it\'s the idea. Startups thrive on new ideas rather than groundbreaking technology. Innovation in web development is driven by necessity, while fields like machine learning, as of early 2020, still have vast uncharted territories, offering ample room for innovation and new, once-unimaginable ideas. In web development, the outcome is often clear, whereas in fields like AI, the potential is still largely unknown. During my time in web development, I realized I was coding, not programming. I aspire to be a far better programmer, not just a coder. It\'s time to move beyond the browser and into the real world of engineering.</p><p>I know this might sound like I\'m disparaging web development, but I\'m not. To each their own. I appreciate web development for what it is. The challenge lies in its complexity, not in its difficulty. It\'s harder to maintain the big picture as it gets complex, but it follows a set flow and predefined rules, even in backend development. I still enjoy web development at my job. It\'s not difficult, so I set myself ambitious deadlines to recapture the thrill I felt during competitive programming. Though web development is fun, lucrative, and useful, I don\'t see it as prestigious. System engineering, machine learning, and solving the unsolvable seem more prestigious to me, perhaps because fewer people venture into those realms.</p><p>With confidence in my technical skills and a couple of unique ideas, I believe I can achieve great things. To me, engineering isn\'t about replicating well-trodden paths (like web development). True engineering is a way of thinking: compartmentalizing, filtering out the noise, distinguishing between noise and gold, simplifying problems to comprehensible dimensions (mathematics), building on past achievements, viewing problems from multiple perspectives, and leveraging human research across various fields to create seamless solutions. That\'s what I believe true engineering is.</p>","time":"25 February 2020","tags":["machine learning"]},{"title":"Pattern Recognition: What\'s next in tech?","content":"<h3>Humble beginnings: The age of digitization</h3><p>First when computers came to be in 1960s and 70s, they where only used by scientists and the tech savy. It was obvious to the inventors that the real application of this invention is not in scientific research but in the hands of general public. Entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs among others were the first to realize this, hence putting all their efforts in making computer accessible to the general public for personal use leading to the foundation of Microsoft and Apple. And they where right! Hence, the explosion of applications of computer in every field that existed. Shreading old methods and making everything digital. <b>It was the inventors who started this revolution but, it was the general public who carried this invention to unimaginable heights.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of globalization</h3><p>Then in 1980s and 1990s a new invention leveraging computers came to be: The internet. At first it was used only for research and military purposes. But the inventor Tim Berners Lee and his team knew the real power of internet can only be attained when made global, internet was made keeping that in mind but only for Government network at that time. So, on 6th August 1991 internet was opened to the public FOR FREE. All of a sudden an explosion of internet startups occured, hiding away another level of abstraction and making it even easier for general public to use it by creating tools such as internet browser. This revolution was much greater and longer than the previous because it allowed people to connect to each other all around the planet. It served as a precursor, a base on which the age of information was yet to establish itself. <b>Again, the revolution was started by the inventor but it was the general public who carried it through and made the invention what it is right now.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of information</h3><p>The mid 1990s but mostly 2000s saw the rise of social networking sites leveraging internet. This started with the invention of Geocities(1994) and AOL instant messenger(1997) where information could be sent and received from anywhere on the planet in miliseconds. The potential of these inventions easily surpassed old methods such as landline, newspaper and the way people connect with each other. This led to another revolution: The fifth estate. Everything could be found on the internet and general public would themself upload their information on the internet. <b>New inventions were made on top of previous inventions(computer, internet) but, it was again the general public driving the revolution.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of automation</h3><p>Started mostly in 2010s meaning we are currently living in the age of automation. The age of information generated(and is still generating) unfathomable amount of data every day which lead to the age of automation. Hence, the next big thing: Artificial Intelligence was born (technically, it was born in 1950s but back then we neither had data nor fast enough hardware to process any meaning out of it.) Again, tools were invented by the visionaries who predicted the changing market, social and economic needs. Using the tools countless applications of AI came into existence. <b>The contribution of general public in this age is their data hence, it\'s again the general public who\'s responsible for driving the revolution.</b></p><h3>The future: Man and machine as one.</h3><p>The pattern I see everytime is that, <b>at first a technology is invented, then a platform is created by the early ones, the visionaries who realize it\'s potential, then it\'s let loose to the general public to leverage that technology and the explosion occurs.</b> One can argue that in the age of automation general public is not directly influencing the revolution. Data is key to automation and that data is produced by general public but still, they are not the ones processing the data, it\'s the Data Scientists. And I think this argument is correct. It\'s like Youtube has been invented but, only Youtube employees can upload video. That\'s the state of AI right now. It needs general public to explode, just like in the case of Youtube, Instagram, Medium etc. But, the age of automation hasn\'t ended yet.</p><p>And that\'s the thing I\'m trying to figure out before switching from Software Engineer to Machine Learning Engineer. How can one give the power of AI in the hands of general public such that they can implement it the way they want. That would be this age\'s revolution. AI explosion hasn\'t happened yet because the power of AI is still in the hands of visionaries and the tech savy. It hasn\'t yet trickled down to the general public, who matters the most.</p>","time":"14 April 2019","tags":["pattern","2019-2025","Industry 5.0"]},{"title":"Project Updates","content":"<h3>Optimizing Personal Project Architecture: A Technical Review and Roadmap</h3>\\n\\n<p>As I approach a potential migration to a new AWS instance, it presents an opportune moment to conduct a comprehensive review and refactoring of our existing projects.

I am happy with what I\'ve built so far. Angular 4 is an awesome framework! It has made the webapp so modular and versatile that each component can co-exist with every other component and together they are forming different states which basically is one of the permutation states. The app seems to run fast and efficient as I don\'t have any additional modules and libraries lying around. Dead-code has been minimized although Angular 4\'s <em>tree-shaking</em> would <em>nail the coffin</em>. The aim was to be light-weight, there was no restrictions on the processing power or anything, I made it such, \'cause <em>why not</em>? Although according to <em>Chrome\'s</em> console the whole app takes 2.3 seconds to load, which is higher than expected. So, I tried running a new project generated via angular-cli and benchmark it. It was taking 1.6 seconds to load the complete seed project. According to that I guess my app is supposed to take 2.3 seconds. I think <em>Spotify</em> is delaying the app. I see the errors for every <em>Spotify</em> player embedded, in the console. Strangers on the Internet are saying that it\'s some <em>Google Chrome</em> SSL certificate permission termination error.

These personal memories will simply be excluded from the final public JSON object. I will code it tomorrow I guess. The next problem would be to rent a Virtual Private Server.

Just like millions times before this plan will also fail, I will complete them if they stay fun otherwise I will give up, I\'m not going to stress over them. Actually you can\'t call this a full-fledged plan. There\'s a deadline but I won\'t care much if I crossed it and I haven\'t even decided the order of the project.

The song is about the legendary airship R101, I went with this name because this webapp is music based and the whole point of this webapp is to store everything on the cloud, considering my music collection an <em>empire</em>. Anyways, I\'m writing in typescript and using angular 4, for the last time I swear. Actually, I guess I will make one desktop app for windows and Linux using angular 4, nodejs and electron.</p><p>I am so psyched to start making this one. I\'m finally doing something for improving my music library\'s accessibility and portability. I\'m curently listening to non-metal songs on a webapp made by some young programmer. I feel such freedom using this app. All I need is internet and my google drive password and I\'ll have access to my music. My carefully hand-picked music and playlists all in 320kbps. Time and again I am forgetting where the music is playing from. When I\'m realizing it\'s from the webapp, and that there\'s no relation to local storage or this computer, it\'s making me feel so secure and free.</p><p>I\'ve wireframed the app and written all the features I need in two parts: essential and luxury features. It would be hard to build this one. I don\'t know most of the concepts this app would require. </p><img style=\\"padding: 10px 0px\\" src = \'https://hmu6bg.bn1301.livefilestore.com/y4mZOoLRylqNFJoe-4ilheJJltn-DXvicuOeM0irpTnZNyzDAEBO-i859v67wfxE3dPIW3rnmg2oy33RlrOGQMzbyqYDRv_Rejla0whrqoNI9Inw6Np4UDZYhUlW2-E_f70VqGm0ppo7kZ8MT8k6pE5_nknSUCyYe1yCyQJdxskc6lkf1Z_EozWwZDdfqIfiOg67rQ81Qim8F1Kz5WhzovvfQ?width=1024&height=765&cropmode=none\' width=\'100%\'><p>Well, I made Memory Sequence in angular 4 and typescript when not knowing shit about them. Making this one requires really good knowledge of the framework. I don\'t know if I will be able to complete it but I will try. </p><p>The webapp I\'m using is doing it\'s job fine but I need way more features. I want to custom make the software for myself. Make it work exactly the way I want and when I want. Also this app doesn\'t feel my type, there\'s no surprise and the design is crappy. I won\'t feel complete freedom unless I use the things I wrote and can control. I am thinking of parsing artist data from last.fm rather than linking to last.fm\'s page. This would make it lengthy but better.</p><p>In a nutshell I just need to implement Google auth and then further figure out the api to implement drive methods, once able to receive from drive I need to make a player and search for how to play audio using typescript then I will have to make the directory in tree structure in the sidebar so that I can drag and drop the artist I want to play and btw I need to implement drag and drop too, once the player is running using the songs from google drive I need to implement last.fm apis and make pages for artists i.e content, inside content component 3 types of pages would open song list, artist info and last.fm stats for the artist and last but surely not the least, completely redesign the app for mobile because it needs to look completely different and auto-responsiveness won\'t work.</p><p>And if I want luxury features too, then add yet another paragraph like that.</p>","tags":["web dev","empire of the clouds","computer science"],"time":"27 August 2017","title":"Project#15: Empire of the clouds"},{"title":"Project#16: Code Scrapper","content":"<p>I have started with a new project. I need a code downloader for downloading my codes from codeforces and uploading them to github automatically. I\'m making this for Linux, Windows and Mac, therefore, I see some future use of this desktop app not only by me but for anyone who want to save their code locally on whichever platform they want. I am using Javascript, nodejs and electron framework for this. </p><p><u>Will build the app and post here simultaneously.</u> <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\'https://github.com/strcoder4007/codeScrapper\'><u>Github Repository</u></a></p><h4><u>Day#1</u></h4><p>Wireframing is done. All I need to do now is to learn how to make desktop apps using electron and make it.</p><p>I\'ve been learning this framework for the past hour and have made a useless but working app, successfully running on my 64 bit Arch Linux.</p><p>A little more decisiveness goes a long way. I did the exact opposite. Added bootstrap and then decided to do something new, therefore, instead bootstrap I\'m going to use Materialize CSS. It\'s new and built on top of Angular Material. I thought of using Angular Material 2 directly but it\'s too early to use that, even the documentation is not yet ready. I\'ve setteled on Materialize CSS. I haven\'t yet read it\'s documentation.</p><p>I have to say, Electron is awesome, but it has yet to go far. Many things are just manual, which I think they can automate in future versions making development faster. Electron is pretty straight forward. It uses IPCrenderer (equivalent to @output/@input in Angular 4) for communication between windows (equivalent to components in Angular 4). Basically the communication is the same as in socket.io.</p><p>Went with frameless window for linux and windows. For mac it\'s native traffic color is used. I am liking Matirialize CSS, it\'s new and therefore it has an easy grid system and implementing something like blockquotes and truely responsive texts is already built-in. Also, it uses my favourite font&mdash;Roboto as default font. No more <code style=\\"background-color: #111\\">npm install --save roboto-fontface</code> haha!</p><h4><u>Day#2</u></h4><p>I\'m confused with the way electron handles data flow, if it even does or not. Should I just use ReactJs? or Angular4? No, not angular, it will unnecessarily make this project bloated. There is a way in electron I guess, by using sections. The thing is, electron doesn\'t divide the application into components, like Angular or React. Therefore, without those frameworks implementing this seems hard. I need to add and remove several nodes from DOM at certain states, there seems no feature like this in electron. I will have to use Vanilla Javascript or one of those two.</p><p>Things have started to make sense now.</p><p>Linux version is working fine, windows version is facing issues and no idea about macos version because I\'m broke, I got no money to buy a mac. Will have to find some online tool to check macos version.</p><p>Frontend is almost done. How electron handles Inter-process communications is now clear.</p><p>Frustrated, lost 2 hours of code. I packaged the application for windows (.exe setup). It was created in the root folder itself. I was committing the progress on github, forgot that setup files are also present in the root and skipping the setup files for uploading was not declared in .gitignore file. Therefore, it started to upload 70mb of those setup files. Then I cancelled it and declared it in .gitignore and committed again. Didn\'t work because git had already staged it. I messed up everything and long story short I lost my code. Now I will have to code it again. My mistake.</p><h4><u>Day#3</u></h4><p>Not going to work on this project today, maybe a little bit if I feel like. Today I need to practice algorithms. I need it for an interview couple of days from now.</p><h4><u>Day#4</u></h4><p>Frontend is complete. Had to re-write the lost code. API\'s are working therefore now I just need to learn how to authenticate using SPOJ\'s APIs and download the code. Downloading from Codeforces doesn\'t require me to authenticate.</p><h4><u>Day#5</u></h4><p>The interface is done. The API is working fine. Although, it will take a couple of seconds to download solutions of user with large problem count. I\'m making GET requests to the API around 200,000 times whenever the download button is clicked. If anyone has more solutions than that then, my bad. The main code for requests and parsing the \\"Accepted\\" solutions was fairly small. Written in vanilla JS I was able to place this block of code in the main file itself which electron uses. </p><p>Anyways, the project is almost done. Took around 9 hours to complete without coding the luxury features. This application can be made a lot better but still, a working version is complete and I want to move on to another project.</p>","time":"28 September 2017","tags":["desktop app","javascript","electron","nodejs","cs","web dev"]},{"title":"Leaving competitive programming","content":"<p>As the number of fields in computer science endlessly seem to grow, it\'s my time to move on. Competitive programming was the first thing I picked up in college. It was recommended to me by my best friend, in 2nd semester. I was learning C from a textbook at that time. I still remember the day I was not able to understand what are test cases and how the program has to be run/submitted on SPOJ. Although, I seriously started with competitive programming 6 months  later. As I didn\'t had computer science in high school, I had to learn some languages first. I learned C, python and haskell (you can guess how much I know this now) my fresher year. Then came back to competitive programming.</p><p>I don\'t want to write about my journey here. In short, I practiced around 150 ad-hoc questions on hackerrank and mathematics questions on project euler. Then slowly I went further deep into competitive programming. Starting with codeforces certainly did mark that. Practiced the hardest I had ever on codeforces, more than 500 ad-hoc questions in the span of 4 months including 14 days holidays. How\'s that for implementation skill? Suddenly I am among the people who know stuff. Focused more on algotithms, learned all graph alorithms, practiced the SPOJ. Then learned more obsecure ones such as fenwick tree, matrix exponentiation and segment trees. Now I am among the good-ish programmers.</p><p>Then came the motivation shift. It was easy to quickly secure the first place in college leaderboard because no one before me took competitive programming seriously. Having the first place on the leaderboard everytime made everyone come after me. Obviously, having 1st place doesn\'t matter shit. It was the fun, I was after. I explained it to myself, comparing myself to my competitors is worthless. But I couldn\'t save myself from getting into that loop of hell. My motivation shifted, I no longer pursued fun, I pursued 1st rank. And everything came falling down. I just can\'t do anything I don\'t like. My practice became stagnant. Web development was different and new for me. Fast forward a year of constantly starting and leaving competitive programming and without making any progress. I gave up competitive programming. Moved on to web dev.</p><p>After not thinking about competitive programming for 4 months. I\'ve started to feel the same way I used to in 2015. It\'s fun again. I\'ve given up on trying. Now, I actually don\'t give a fuck. I can again pursue just fun in competitive programming. So, I\'ve decided to move on to machine learning as I\'ve made a resonable number of projects in web development. And as for competitive programming, I will do it whenever I feel like. I don\'t have a goal. Therefore, I don\'t have a strong motivation for improving. If I feel like, I will learn new algorithms as well.

This is probably the last web dev project I\'m going to do.</p><p>This app would compare certain syntaxes of multiple languages side by side so that you can see the syntactic difference. Syntaxes such as if, for, while, foreach, return, function(), arrays, lists, vectors, sets, slicing, string functions etc. I\'m a little rusty in reactjs. And as you know in javascript\'s scene, react would have changed so much since the time I last used it, I rather learn it again. Haven\'t yet decided on CSS library.

Ionic framework heavily depends on Angular framework and that\'s awesome for me. After installing cordova and ionic I went on to open package.json to see the versions of all the dependencies used. To my surprise Ionic 3 uses Angular 5! It was just released a month ago and they have a full support for Angular 5 already with all of it\'s modules updated to version 5. That was cool to see. Now I will have to learn the concepts introduced in Angular 5 as well.</p><p>The interface of this app will be simple for now because I will concentrate on implementing the backend features I have in my mind. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the obsecure but still useful features of a real time messaging app. The features I have in mind are as follows:<br><ul><li>Have a bot integration.</li><li>Send messages at a specific time set by you.</li><li>Bot to mimic as user. Auto pilot mode. Like sending \\"yesterday\'s photos to a friend\\" automatically when that friend asks.</li><li>Going private on click. Either of the user can ask the other to go private. In private mode messages will have constricted length and will get permanentally deleted after 5 seconds.</li></ul></p><p>These are the features I have in mind right now. I\'m not sure if I will be able to implement the bot to mimic because there is not much data available for any particular user for the neural net to learn. I need large amount of structured data to train the neural net.

Push and pop are available functions and the router is the same as stack of pages.</p><p>Started making the app. Started with coding a little frontend so that the backend can be tested later. The home page is done on the frontend part. No backend yet.</p><h4><u>Day#2</u></h4><p>populated the users with json placeholders. Placed the tab on top.</p><p>Made the chat page. Used AlertController and ActionSheetController for asking to go private and other options.</p><p>Tested for both android and iOS, both working fine.</p><p>I really like how data moves in Ionic. There are many ways for components/page to talk including the ones using Angular\'s service and eventemitters. Ionic has it\'s own way as well using navPrams. It\'s from the NavigationController, amazing!!! Angular should implement the same in their router module, that would make talking much easier.</p><p>Cleaned the app. Removed the dead code.</p><p>I just found out that I can test this app on my mobile in real-time and that too without any extra work.
