This blog post delves into visualizing hidden layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch and Matplotlib, offering insights into the feature extraction process and model behavior.</p>\\n\\n<h3>1. Introduction</h3>\\n\\n<p>Deep CNNs have achieved exceptional performance in various computer vision tasks. However, their intricate architectures often obscure their decision-making processes. Visualizing the activations of hidden layers can illuminate the features and patterns learned by these networks, providing a clearer view of their functionality.</p>\\n\\n<h3>2. Data Collection and Processing</h3>\\n\\n<p>For this project, we utilized the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in the field of image classification. This dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). We chose MNIST due to its simplicity and the ease with which we can test our visualization techniques.</p>\\n\\n<p>The data was collected from the torchvision library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for loading and transforming datasets. We applied basic preprocessing, including normalization, to ensure the images were suitable for our CNN. Normalization helps in speeding up the training process and improving the model\'s performance.</p>\\n\\n<h3>3. Implementation Overview</h3>\\n\\n<p>The implementation comprises three main components:</p>\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Building and training a CNN with PyTorch</li>\\n    <li>Extracting activations from hidden layers</li>\\n    <li>Visualizing these activations using Matplotlib</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>4. Setting Up the Environment</h3>\\n\\n<p>We begin by importing the necessary libraries:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>import torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torch.optim as optim\\nimport torchvision\\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport numpy as np</code></pre>\\n\\n<h3>5. Constructing the CNN Architecture</h3>\\n\\n<p>We defined a simple CNN with two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>class Net(nn.Module):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        super(Net, self).__init__()\\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 10, kernel_size=5)\\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(10, 20, kernel_size=5)\\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(320, 50)\\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)\\n\\n    def forward(self, x):\\n        x = torch.relu(torch.max_pool2d(self.conv1(x), 2))\\n        x = torch.relu(torch.max_pool2d(self.conv2(x), 2))\\n        x = x.view(-1, 320)\\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))\\n        x = self.fc2(x)\\n        return x\\n\\nnet = Net()</code></pre>\\n\\n<h3>6. Training the Model</h3>\\n\\n<p>We trained the model using the MNIST dataset with the following setup:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code># Load MNIST dataset\\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))])\\ntrain_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(\\n    torchvision.datasets.MNIST(\'./data\', train=True, download=True, transform=transform),\\n    batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\\n\\n# Define loss function and optimizer\\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\\noptimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)\\n\\n# Training loop\\nfor epoch in range(5):\\n    running_loss = 0.0\\n    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):\\n        inputs, labels = data\\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\\n        outputs = net(inputs)\\n        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)\\n        loss.backward()\\n        optimizer.step()\\n        running_loss += loss.item()\\n    print(f\'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {running_loss / len(train_loader):.3f}\')</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>During training, we monitored the loss to gauge the model\'s performance. After 5 epochs, the model demonstrated a reasonable convergence, though further tuning and longer training might improve results.</p>\\n\\n<h3>7. Model Selection and Evaluation</h3>\\n\\n<p>We initially experimented with the following models:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>**Basic CNN**: As outlined above, with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.</li>\\n    <li>**Deeper CNN**: Added more convolutional layers and increased filter sizes.</li>\\n    <li>**Pre-trained Models**: We tried using pre-trained models like VGG and ResNet for feature extraction.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The basic CNN served as a good starting point. While the deeper CNN showed promise, it required more computational resources and tuning. Surprisingly, the pre-trained models offered valuable insights but were less effective in this context due to MNIST\'s simplicity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Evaluation was performed using the test set, measuring accuracy and loss. The basic CNN model showed good performance with an accuracy of around 98%, whereas the deeper CNN achieved marginally better accuracy but with increased training time.</p>\\n\\n<h3>8. Visualizing Hidden Layer Activations</h3>\\n\\n<p>We implemented a function to visualize activations from the first convolutional layer:</p>\\n\\n<pre style=\\"background-color: #222; padding: 5px 10px\\"><code>def visualize_layer(layer, input_tensor):\\n    # Forward pass through the layer\\n    activation = layer(input_tensor)\\n    \\n    # Convert to numpy array\\n    act_imshow = activation.detach().cpu().numpy()\\n    \\n    # Create subplots for each channel\\n    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(12, 6))\\n    fig.suptitle(\'Feature Maps of First Convolutional Layer\')\\n    for idx in range(10):\\n        ax = axs[idx//5, idx%5]\\n        ax.imshow(act_imshow[0, idx], cmap=\'viridis\')\\n        ax.axis(\'off\')\\n    plt.tight_layout()\\n    plt.show()\\n\\n# Obtain a sample image\\ndataiter = iter(train_loader)\\nimages, labels = next(dataiter)\\n\\n# Visualize the first convolutional layer\\nvisualize_layer(net.conv1, images[0:1])</code></pre>\\n\\n<h3>9. Interpreting the Visualizations</h3>\\n\\n<p>The visualizations show the feature maps from the first convolutional layer. Brighter areas indicate stronger activations, revealing where the network detects features. Typically, early layers capture simple features like edges and textures, while deeper layers identify complex patterns specific to the task.</p>\\n\\n<h3>10. Advanced Visualization Techniques</h3>\\n\\n<p>While basic visualizations are helpful, advanced techniques can offer deeper insights:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li><strong>Guided Backpropagation:</strong> Highlights which parts of the input image influence specific neuron activations.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM):</strong> Provides visual explanations for predictions by emphasizing important image regions.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Feature Inversion:</strong> Reconstructs the input image from feature representations, showing what information is preserved at each layer.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h3>11. Future Directions</h3>\\n\\n<p>If I were to revisit this project, I\'d explore more sophisticated models and techniques for visualization. For instance, experimenting with deeper architectures and different types of layers might yield better insights. Additionally, applying these techniques to more complex datasets could provide more nuanced understanding and improved model interpretability.</p>\\n\\n<h3>12. Conclusion</h3>\\n\\n<p>Visualizing hidden layers in neural networks is a powerful approach for enhancing model transparency and debugging. By peering into the network\'s inner workings, we gain valuable insights into its decision-making processes and can potentially identify areas for improvement. As deep learning continues to advance, techniques like these are crucial for developing more interpretable and effective artificial intelligence systems.</p>","time":"24 July 2024","tags":["Visualizing layer","Deep learning","Convolutional Neural Networks"]},{"title":"Need For Speed Self Driving Car","content":"<h3>Training a ConvNet to Race in Need for Speed: Most Wanted</h3>\\n\\n<p>In this post, we\'ll explore how to train a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to play Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005).

Here are some key observations:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Data Imbalance</strong>: Our model had a strong bias towards driving straight, likely due to overrepresentation in the training data. This highlights the importance of balanced datasets in imitation learning.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Overfitting</strong>: The model showed signs of memorizing specific tracks rather than generalizing driving skills. This suggests we might need more diverse training data or stronger regularization.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Action Oscillation</strong>: Rapid switching between left and right turns led to a \\"wiggle\\" effect. This could potentially be mitigated by incorporating temporal information, perhaps through a recurrent architecture or frame stacking.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Computational Constraints</strong>: Running game emulation, screen capture, and neural network inference simultaneously pushed our hardware to its limits. This underscores the need for efficient, real-time inference in game-playing AI.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Dynamic Obstacle Handling</strong>: The model struggled with traffic and police cars, indicating a need for more sophisticated environment understanding.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Future Directions</h3>\\n<p>This project opens up several exciting avenues for further research:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Instead of imitation learning, we could frame this as a RL problem, allowing the agent to discover optimal driving strategies through trial and error.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Multi-Task Learning</strong>: We could extend our model to handle not just driving, but also higher-level tasks like race completion or police evasion.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Curriculum Learning</strong>: Starting with simple, traffic-free scenarios and gradually increasing complexity could lead to more robust agents.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Transfer Learning</strong>: Can driving skills learned in Need for Speed transfer to other racing games, or even to real-world autonomous driving simulations?</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>Training an AI to play Need for Speed: Most Wanted is more than just a fun project—it\'s a microcosm of the challenges we face in real-world autonomous driving. By tackling these problems in a controlled, virtual environment, we can gain insights that may prove valuable as we work towards fully autonomous vehicles.</p>\\n\\n<p>Remember, the code for this project is available on GitHub.

This sparse reward structure can make learning difficult, as the agent receives limited feedback on its actions. We might consider reward shaping to provide more frequent learning signals.</li>\\n    <li><strong>High-Dimensional State Space</strong>: Using raw pixel data as input results in a very large state space, which can slow down learning. Techniques like frame stacking or using a more compact state representation (e.g., Mario\'s position, velocity, and nearby obstacles) could potentially improve learning efficiency.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Partial Observability</strong>: The game screen provides only partial information about the game state. The agent cannot see what\'s coming ahead, which makes long-term planning challenging. This is a common issue in many real-world reinforcement learning problems.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Temporal Credit Assignment</strong>: Many actions in Mario have delayed effects (e.g., jumping to avoid an enemy you can\'t see yet). This makes it difficult for the agent to associate actions with their long-term consequences. Techniques like n-step returns or eligibility traces might help address this issue.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off</strong>: Balancing exploration of the environment with exploitation of known good strategies is crucial. The epsilon-greedy approach we\'ve used is a simple way to handle this, but more sophisticated methods like intrinsic motivation or parameter noise for exploration could potentially yield better results.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Future Directions</h3>\\n\\n<p>This project opens up several interesting avenues for further research:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Advanced Architectures</strong>: Experimenting with more sophisticated network architectures, such as dueling DQN or distributional DQN, could potentially improve performance.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Multi-task Learning</strong>: Training the agent to play multiple Mario levels or even different NES games could lead to more robust and general game-playing agents.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Meta-learning</strong>: Investigating meta-learning approaches to allow the agent to adapt quickly to new levels or game variations.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Implementing a hierarchical approach where high-level policies (e.g., \\"complete the level\\") are composed of lower-level policies (e.g., \\"jump over obstacle\\") could potentially handle the complexity of the game more effectively.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n\\n<p>Training an AI to play Super Mario Bros serves as an excellent case study in deep reinforcement learning. It encompasses many of the challenges we face in more complex, real-world applications of RL, such as robotics or autonomous driving. By tackling these problems in a controlled, simulated environment, we can gain valuable insights that may transfer to more practical applications.</p>\\n\\n<p>The code for this project is available on GitHub.

While competitive programming felt like true engineering, web development, especially frontend, does not. Six years in, I aspire to be an engineer in the truest sense. As people venture to Mars, I\'m here centering text in a div. Both are labeled \\"Engineering,\\" but how can I equate my work to theirs? The difference in impact, skill, and excitement is stark, making me question if I\'m truly utilizing my potential. No matter how proficient I become in web development, I\'ll always feel my mind could be better applied to System Engineering or Machine Learning, tackling the truly challenging problems. Web development may seem filled with unsolvable tasks, but I disagree. At best, it\'s about novel ideas and doing something new within the browser.</p><p>At the end of the day, coding for the web isn\'t the bottleneck; it\'s the idea. Startups thrive on new ideas rather than groundbreaking technology. Innovation in web development is driven by necessity, while fields like machine learning, as of early 2020, still have vast uncharted territories, offering ample room for innovation and new, once-unimaginable ideas. In web development, the outcome is often clear, whereas in fields like AI, the potential is still largely unknown. During my time in web development, I realized I was coding, not programming. I aspire to be a far better programmer, not just a coder. It\'s time to move beyond the browser and into the real world of engineering.</p><p>I know this might sound like I\'m disparaging web development, but I\'m not. To each their own. I appreciate web development for what it is. The challenge lies in its complexity, not in its difficulty. It\'s harder to maintain the big picture as it gets complex, but it follows a set flow and predefined rules, even in backend development. I still enjoy web development at my job. It\'s not difficult, so I set myself ambitious deadlines to recapture the thrill I felt during competitive programming. Though web development is fun, lucrative, and useful, I don\'t see it as prestigious. System engineering, machine learning, and solving the unsolvable seem more prestigious to me, perhaps because fewer people venture into those realms.</p><p>With confidence in my technical skills and a couple of unique ideas, I believe I can achieve great things. To me, engineering isn\'t about replicating well-trodden paths (like web development). True engineering is a way of thinking: compartmentalizing, filtering out the noise, distinguishing between noise and gold, simplifying problems to comprehensible dimensions (mathematics), building on past achievements, viewing problems from multiple perspectives, and leveraging human research across various fields to create seamless solutions.

It was obvious to the inventors that the real application of this invention is not in scientific research but in the hands of general public. Entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs(visionary but still, fuck him) among others were the first to realize this, hence putting all their efforts in making computer accessible to the general public for personal use leading to the foundation of Microsoft and Apple. And they where right! Hence, the explosion of applications of computer in every field that existed. Shreading old methods and making everything digital. <b>It was the inventors who started this revolution but, it was the general public who carried this invention to unimaginable heights.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of globalization</h3><p>Then in 1980s and 1990s a new invention leveraging computers came to be: The internet. At first it was used only for research and military purposes. But the inventor Tim Berners Lee and his team knew the real power of internet can only be attained when made global, internet was made keeping that in mind but only for Government network at that time. So, on 6th August 1991 internet was opened to the public FOR FREE. All of a sudden an explosion of internet startups occured, hiding away another level of abstraction and making it even easier for general public to use it by creating tools such as internet browser. This revolution was much greater and longer than the previous because it allowed people to connect to each other all around the planet. It served as a precursor, a base on which the age of information was yet to establish itself. <b>Again, the revolution was started by the inventor but it was the general public who carried it through and made the invention what it is right now.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of information</h3><p>The mid 1990s but mostly 2000s saw the rise of social networking sites leveraging internet. This started with the invention of Geocities(1994) and AOL instant messenger(1997) where information could be sent and received from anywhere on the planet in miliseconds. The potential of these inventions easily surpassed old methods such as landline, newspaper and the way people connect with each other. This led to another revolution: The fifth estate. Everything could be found on the internet and general public would themself upload their information on the internet. <b>New inventions were made on top of previous inventions(computer, internet) but, it was again the general public driving the revolution.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of automation</h3><p>Started mostly in 2010s meaning we are currently living in the age of automation. The age of information generated(and is still generating) unfathomable amount of data every day which lead to the age of automation. Hence, the next big thing: Artificial Intelligence was born (technically, it was born in 1950s but back then we neither had data nor fast enough hardware to process any meaning out of it.) Again, tools were invented by the visionaries who predicted the changing market, social and economic needs. Using the tools countless applications of AI came into existence. <b>The contribution of general public in this age is their data hence, it\'s again the general public who\'s responsible for driving the revolution.</b></p><h3>The future: Man and machine as one.</h3><p>The pattern I see everytime is that, <b>at first a technology is invented, then a platform is created by the early ones, the visionaries who realize it\'s potential, then it\'s let loose to the general public to leverage that technology and the explosion occurs.</b> One can argue that in the age of automation general public is not directly influencing the revolution. Data is key to automation and that data is produced by general public but still, they are not the ones processing the data, it\'s the Data Scientists. And I think this argument is correct. It\'s like Youtube has been invented but, only Youtube employees can upload video. That\'s the state of AI right now. It needs general public to explode, just like in the case of Youtube, Instagram, Medium etc. But, the age of automation hasn\'t ended yet.</p><p>And that\'s the thing I\'m trying to figure out before switching from Software Engineer to Machine Learning Engineer. How can one give the power of AI in the hands of general public such that they can implement it the way they want. That would be this age\'s revolution. AI explosion hasn\'t happened yet because the power of AI is still in the hands of visionaries and the tech savy.

It\'s nice because it\'s producing the final HTML in minified format. I just need a way to automate this process. I should look into the features of this editor. Maybe there\'s a way to convert the HTML into JSON&nbsp;somehow. That would be so easy for me then. Will have to write extra code for user layer for login, that would require me to study MongoDB. Well, let\'s see how this goes.</p><p>I got an idea, some implementation of adding notes to memories. Although it would require me to manually add them in data.json file which will be tiresome. We will see about that. I have decided to leave data.json to be my primary and quite frankly the only way to update/add memories. I just need to figure out AWS. It\'s so fucking confusing. I configured it to run blue/green deployment but my server where not stopping, even when I terminated them manually, new servers kept popping up!</p><p>And this is the reason why you should plan your project properly before starting it. I don\'t have continous integration or any server to put this project on or the final wireframe of the project. When they say that you should wireframe your project first, I hope they know that most probably there will be major changes to the project in the future. I should have wireframed properly eitherways. Now I need to shift everything from base component to a new component of itself such that I can summon it anywhere in the base component as a part of the it. And similarly make new components as a child of the base component. If I had thought about this earlier then it would have saved much of my time now. So, I guess wireframing is important even though you will have to change most of it in the end.</p>","tags":["computer science","development","dio","wireframe"],"time":"28 July 2017","title":"MS#03: Building the website: Wireframing?"},{"content":"<p>I want to write about the project as I don\'t have any strong feeling towards something or any other substancial thing to write about.I have been working on this project for 12 days now. I am happy with what I\'ve built so far. Angular 4 is an awesome framework! It has made the webapp so modular and versatile that each component can co-exist with every other component and together they are forming different states which basically is one of the permutation states. The app seems to run fast and efficient as I don\'t have any additional modules and libraries lying around. Dead-code has been minimized although Angular 4\'s <em>tree-shaking</em> would <em>nail the coffin</em>. The aim was to be light-weight, there was no restrictions on the processing power or anything, I made it such, \'cause <em>why not</em>? Although according to <em>Chrome\'s</em> console the whole app takes 2.3 seconds to load, which is higher than expected. So, I tried running a new project generated via angular-cli and benchmark it. It was taking 1.6 seconds to load the complete seed project. According to that I guess my app is supposed to take 2.3 seconds. I think <em>Spotify</em> is delaying the app. I see the errors for every <em>Spotify</em> player embedded, in the console. Strangers on the Internet are saying that it\'s some <em>Google Chrome</em> SSL certificate permission termination error. The solution provided didn\'t worked.</p><p>The webapp is more or less completed, the only things left is the admin layer and search linking. I have found the solution as to how I can make this webapp public and at the same time use it the way I wanted. The idea is to add an admin layer such that all the memories with \\"personal\\" tag on them will only be shown to me. These personal memories will simply be excluded from the final public JSON object. I will code it tomorrow I guess. The next problem would be to rent a Virtual Private Server. I am afraid in using my Dad\'s card for paying on services which automatically charge you after your free subscription gets over. I am very lazy and careless at this. I need a company where it\'s paid monthly or completly free, although the later is hard to find. It just happened to me the other day, I rented a VPS from <em>Amazon</em> and it was fine and working, I even checked <em>blue/green deployment</em>, it all worked. After getting bored off playing with it, I went on to some other project. Four days later, I found, while I was messing with AWS I started four instances and all of them have been continuously running since. The free(which is $1) limit was 750hrs and I was doing 940hrs.</p><p>Tomorrow I definitely will score a server. I hope Digital Ocean has <em>Continuous Integration</em>.

Skills in short-term goal are those which I need for mediocre jobs most probably in a start-up, keeping myself on the forefront of technology will help here. For completing short-term goals I think I should continue doing web dev and try learning the obscure parts such as RxJs, ReactJs, make software I need to automate my life thus, encouraging my sloth behavior and eventually taking me to the next level of laziness. Similarly for long-term goal i.e aiming for a job in really good startup most probably abroad. Getting sponsored for a visa is getting harder, although it\'s relatively easier for developers. Some European countries have a special job skills which a migrant can have, fortunately, software engineering related skills are the ones most in demand. For these startups and companies, I will require having a wider knowledge in computer science. I come from an algorithm(C++) background so I can say a huge &amp; a fairly difficult part is already covered. Game development in C++ would teach me the other side of the language the Object Oriented Programming side. I need to learn machine learning as well. It seems really fun. Actually, I don\'t know shit about machine learning, I ain\'t got anything else to write about it other than that the projects are in a different dimension and I really want to try it.

Most probably it\'s nothing, it was like this because I didn\'t make the personal filter and because of that storing the data was time-takingly painful. I am again headed to the place where I was headed back in May. The funny thing is that it made the <em>new me</em> (I know these words have a touch of naiveness and are filled with ego but I can\'t think of any replacement right now) scared for a moment.

It\'s just a phase I guess, you know, the immitation you do when you are completely polarized by someone. Although I won\'t mind if I started living on his principles and acting the way he did. Actually that\'s what I want, this is the first time I\'ve found a balance between programming and drugs. A balance which still needs improvement but a working one nonetheless. Living on Hunter S. Thompson\'s principles would actually make me better at my craft. He is one of the <em>interesting people</em> I will write about soon. I just realized the title of this blog is \\"Life Update\\" and I haven\'t written shit on it yet. Programming is going slow these days. I am not able to write enough code these days because this weed is making me such a sloth. I don\'t feel like programming because of it. Even the aim of the day is not a lucrative one&mdash;<em>fix the login layer and try to find a way to map tags to searched string</em>. I want something more interesting than this. Actually these objectives mark the end of the project. I guess what\'s going on is my ignorance towards <em>almost</em> completed jobs. I do this when the job is more or less completed (but still incomplete) to the point where it can be practically said that it\'s completed. There\'s a model which is up and running in all it\'s glory but the luxury features are pending. The problem with this is that I leave the job incomplete and when I need them in future to show or use it in another project, I will have to complete it, but by then the technology in which it\'s written would have already aged like a motherfucker and I won\'t have any choice other than setting the project aside. I don\'t care much if I set myself straight but I recommend I should, it will save a lot of time in the future. I should start something hard. Game programming I guess. I want to be sober now. I want my brain to function normally. I want to feel the high of making new shit, music and writing. I need to get out of this room more frequently. College could be an option, there\'s food too.

I thought of using Angular Material 2 directly but it\'s too early to use that, even the documentation is not yet ready. I\'ve setteled on Materialize CSS. I haven\'t yet read it\'s documentation.</p><p>I have to say, Electron is awesome, but it has yet to go far. Many things are just manual, which I think they can automate in future versions making development faster. Electron is pretty straight forward. It uses IPCrenderer (equivalent to @output/@input in Angular 4) for communication between windows (equivalent to components in Angular 4). Basically the communication is the same as in socket.io.</p><p>Went with frameless window for linux and windows. For mac it\'s native traffic color is used. I am liking Matirialize CSS, it\'s new and therefore it has an easy grid system and implementing something like blockquotes and truely responsive texts is already built-in. Also, it uses my favourite font&mdash;Roboto as default font. No more <code style=\\"background-color: #111\\">npm install --save roboto-fontface</code> haha!</p><h4><u>Day#2</u></h4><p>I\'m confused with the way electron handles data flow, if it even does or not. Should I just use ReactJs? or Angular4? No, not angular, it will unnecessarily make this project bloated. There is a way in electron I guess, by using sections. The thing is, electron doesn\'t divide the application into components, like Angular or React. Therefore, without those frameworks implementing this seems hard.

Competitive programming was the first thing I picked up in college. It was recommended to me by my best friend, in 2nd semester. I was learning C from a textbook at that time. I still remember the day I was not able to understand what are test cases and how the program has to be run/submitted on SPOJ. Although, I seriously started with competitive programming 6 months  later. As I didn\'t had computer science in high school, I had to learn some languages first. I learned C, python and haskell (you can guess how much I know this now) my fresher year. Then came back to competitive programming.</p><p>I don\'t want to write about my journey here. In short, I practiced around 150 ad-hoc questions on hackerrank and mathematics questions on project euler. Then slowly I went further deep into competitive programming. Starting with codeforces certainly did mark that. Practiced the hardest I had ever on codeforces, more than 500 ad-hoc questions in the span of 4 months including 14 days holidays. How\'s that for implementation skill? Suddenly I am among the people who know stuff. Focused more on algotithms, learned all graph alorithms, practiced the SPOJ. Then learned more obsecure ones such as fenwick tree, matrix exponentiation and segment trees. Now I am among the good-ish programmers.</p><p>Then came the motivation shift. It was easy to quickly secure the first place in college leaderboard because no one before me took competitive programming seriously. Having the first place on the leaderboard everytime made everyone come after me. Obviously, having 1st place doesn\'t matter shit. It was the fun, I was after. I explained it to myself, comparing myself to my competitors is worthless. But I couldn\'t save myself from getting into that loop of hell. My motivation shifted, I no longer pursued fun, I pursued 1st rank. And everything came falling down. I just can\'t do anything I don\'t like. My practice became stagnant. Web development was different and new for me. Fast forward a year of constantly starting and leaving competitive programming and without making any progress. I gave up competitive programming. Moved on to web dev.</p><p>After not thinking about competitive programming for 4 months. I\'ve started to feel the same way I used to in 2015. It\'s fun again. I\'ve given up on trying. Now, I actually don\'t give a fuck. I can again pursue just fun in competitive programming. So, I\'ve decided to move on to machine learning as I\'ve made a resonable number of projects in web development. And as for competitive programming, I will do it whenever I feel like.

Push and pop are available functions and the router is the same as stack of pages.</p><p>Started making the app. Started with coding a little frontend so that the backend can be tested later. The home page is done on the frontend part. No backend yet.</p><h4><u>Day#2</u></h4><p>populated the users with json placeholders. Placed the tab on top.</p><p>Made the chat page. Used AlertController and ActionSheetController for asking to go private and other options.</p><p>Tested for both android and iOS, both working fine.</p><p>I really like how data moves in Ionic. There are many ways for components/page to talk including the ones using Angular\'s service and eventemitters. Ionic has it\'s own way as well using navPrams. It\'s from the NavigationController, amazing!!! Angular should implement the same in their router module, that would make talking much easier.</p><p>Cleaned the app. Removed the dead code.</p><p>I just found out that I can test this app on my mobile in real-time and that too without any extra work. A duplicate server runs on the wifi network. That is such a brilliant idea. Mind = Blown.</p>","time":"16 November 2017","tags":["project","web dev","angular","ionic"]},{"title":"Project#19: Creek","content":"<p>This is going to be a simple web app usable right out of the box. Writing this in typescript using angular5 and nodejs (yet again). This is one of those apps that I\'m gonna use on daily basis, aiding me in keeping myself up to date with the new albums from the artists I love. Now, adding my favourite artists is not going to be done manually! Using last.fm api I will get all the artists I\'ve listented to this far. This list will be full of artists which I don\'t want as well. Therefore, I will filter the artists whose atleast N songs I\'ve listened. Where N can be set by the user depending on his/her needs. I\'m setting it to 10 by default.</p><p>So, basically I want something where I could go and instantly get oncoming albums. I don\'t need to make any extra effort at all for this app to work. No artists to add, literally.</p><p><u>Will build the app and log here simultaneously</u></p><h4><u>Day#1</u></h4><p>Created the structure of the app. Added dependencies and committed to <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\'https://github.com/strcoder4007/creek\'><u>github</u></a></p><p>Started frontend.
