    "content": "<p>I have been programming for the last six years, two and a half years of competitive programming and the rest web development. To me competitive programming did feel like engineering but web dev does not. Web development, especially frontend is not much engineering. Six years in and now I want to be an engineer through and through. People are setting off for Mars and I'm here centering text in a div. Both are called \"Engineering\", but how can I consider myself to be in their category? The difference in impact, skill and thrill is so damn much, how can I deny that I'm not wasting my time. It doesn't matter how good I get at web development, I will always feel like my mind could be better utilized in System Engineering or Machine Learning on solving the unsolvable. Web development is full of unsolvable tasks, you say? I disagree, web dev is not about solving the unsolvable, at the very best it's about new ideas, doing something that has not been done before and that too only in browser.</p><p>At the end of the day, coding web is not the bottleneck, it's the idea. You see that's why startups are unicorn-ing based on new ideas, rarely do any of these have new/exceptional tech. Idea or a necessity is what drives innovation in web dev while as of early 2020, fields like machine learning have a lot of stuff still undiscovered, so a lot of room to innovate themselves which in turn paves way for new ideas, ideas which were unthought of or laughable once. In this age the result of web development is clear while in fields like AI the result in unknown. We don't know what or how much more it can do. All this time in web development while I was \"developing software\", I was coding not programming. What I want to say is, I want to be a far better programmer and not be a coder in the very least. It's time to get out of the browser and into the real world of engineering.</p><p>I know it feels like I'm dissing web development, but I'm not. I guess, to each his own. I love web development for what it is. The problem is that it gets complex at it's extreme but not hard. Harder to keep the big picture in mind when it gets complex, yes, but it has the same flow and predefined set of rules to follow even in backend. I still find web dev fun at my job. It's not hard so I give myself illogical deadlines to feel the thrill I felt back in competitive programming days. Web development though fun, $$$ and useful, I cannot consider it to be something prestigious, while on the other hand, system engineering, machine learning and solving the unsolvable seem prestigious to me. I guess because there are a lot less people setting on to solve the unsolvable.</p><p>If I have confidence in my tech and have two or more ideas which have never been used together before, this alone can get me pretty far. To me engineering is not replicating the exact flow of what others have done millions of times (eg: web dev), the essence of engineering is felt in real-time, it's a way of thinking, to know how to compartmentalise, to water down the noise, to be able to know what's noise and what's gold, to reduce the problem down to dimensions we can comprehend (mathematics), to to build upon previous feats, to look with multiple perspectives, to be able to use human research already done in wide variety of fields inorder to come up with new seemless solutions. That's what I think true engineering is.</p><p>P.S. By unsolvable I mean unsolvable yet.</p>",

    "content": "<h3>Humble beginnings: The age of digitization</h3><p>First when computers came to be in 1960s and 70s, they where only used by scientists and the tech savy. It was obvious to the inventors that the real application of this invention is not in scientific research but in the hands of general public. Entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs(visionary but still, fuck him) among others were the first to realize this, hence putting all their efforts in making computer accessible to the general public for personal use leading to the foundation of Microsoft and Apple. And they where right! Hence, the explosion of applications of computer in every field that existed. Shreading old methods and making everything digital. <b>It was the inventors who started this revolution but, it was the general public who carried this invention to unimaginable heights.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of globalization</h3><p>Then in 1980s and 1990s a new invention leveraging computers came to be: The internet. At first it was used only for research and military purposes. But the inventor Tim Berners Lee and his team knew the real power of internet can only be attained when made global, internet was made keeping that in mind but only for Government network at that time. So, on 6th August 1991 internet was opened to the public FOR FREE. All of a sudden an explosion of internet startups occured, hiding away another level of abstraction and making it even easier for general public to use it by creating tools such as internet browser. This revolution was much greater and longer than the previous because it allowed people to connect to each other all around the planet. It served as a precursor, a base on which the age of information was yet to establish itself. <b>Again, the revolution was started by the inventor but it was the general public who carried it through and made the invention what it is right now.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of information</h3><p>The mid 1990s but mostly 2000s saw the rise of social networking sites leveraging internet. This started with the invention of Geocities(1994) and AOL instant messenger(1997) where information could be sent and received from anywhere on the planet in miliseconds. The potential of these inventions easily surpassed old methods such as landline, newspaper and the way people connect with each other. This led to another revolution: The fifth estate. Everything could be found on the internet and general public would themself upload their information on the internet. <b>New inventions were made on top of previous inventions(computer, internet) but, it was again the general public driving the revolution.</b></p><h3>Pattern in the age of automation</h3><p>Started mostly in 2010s meaning we are currently living in the age of automation. The age of information generated(and is still generating) unfathomable amount of data every day which lead to the age of automation. Hence, the next big thing: Artificial Intelligence was born (technically, it was born in 1950s but back then we neither had data nor fast enough hardware to process any meaning out of it.) Again, tools were invented by the visionaries who predicted the changing market, social and economic needs. Using the tools countless applications of AI came into existence. <b>The contribution of general public in this age is their data hence, it's again the general public who's responsible for driving the revolution.</b></p><h3>The future: Man and machine as one.</h3><p>The pattern I see everytime is that, <b>at first a technology is invented, then a platform is created by the early ones, the visionaries who realize it's potential, then it's let loose to the general public to leverage that technology and the explosion occurs.</b> One can argue that in the age of automation general public is not directly influencing the revolution. Data is key to automation and that data is produced by general public but still, they are not the ones processing the data, it's the Data Scientists. And I think this argument is correct. It's like Youtube has been invented but, only Youtube employees can upload video. That's the state of AI right now. It needs general public to explode, just like in the case of Youtube, Instagram, Medium etc. But, the age of automation hasn't ended yet.</p><p>And that's the thing I'm trying to figure out before switching from Software Engineer to Machine Learning Engineer. How can one give the power of AI in the hands of general public such that they can implement it the way they want. That would be this age's revolution. AI explosion hasn't happened yet because the power of AI is still in the hands of visionaries and the tech savy. It hasn't yet trickled down to the general public, who matters the most.</p>",

I've been meaning to update them and add new features which I'll enumerate below for each of them. Some projects have proved themselves to be very useful and I find myself using them all the time over the past year. I'm also going to update CSS libraries, frameworks, their CLIs, npm (thinking about switching to yarn) and node to their latest version and try to make each app as progressive as possible.</p><h3>Project#15: Empire of the clouds (ReactJS)</h3><p>This is the most postponed project ever and can't be postponed anymore, I urgently need a universal app for music streaming and organization i.e, it should run on every device and always be ready with my updated library <strong>everywhere automatically</strong>. I need to build a web app that can:</p><ul><li>stream my music files stored on Google Drive</li><li>a web player with amazing UI/UX</li><li>scrobble my track to last.fm</li><li>very lightweight hence, reactjs</li></ul><h3>Time my Show update (Angular 7 + Apollo + GraphQL)</h3><p><a href=\"http://shubhamswe.xyz/tms\" target=\"_blank\">Time my Show</a> works but it's not built good enough to be used every day as I didn't give much time to this project when I wrote it. In the past year it has proven it's utility. Therefore, it needs improvements and bug fixings! <a href=\"https://github.com/strcoder4007/timeMyShow\" target=\"_blank\">Github repo</a><br />I need:</p><ul><li>graphql for all APIs</li><li>to show the number of seasons and number of episodes in the season as well.</li><li>to fix routing.</li><li>to add some kind of Indicator to hint typing in the banner.</li><li>to implement database possibly postgresql or mongodb.</li><li>sorted new episodes on top</li><li>to update to Angular 7</li></ul><h3>Memory Sequence update (Angular 7 + MongoDB)</h3><p>This very project needs an update. It has been the most useful project yet. I use it almost every day. I have a list of ideas that I have accumulated over the last year that I want to implement in this project. <a href=\"https://github.com/strcoder4007/memorySequence\" target=\"_blank\">Github repo</a><br />I need:</p><ul><li>font options</li><li>writing stats</li><li>to make it completely progressive</li><li>remember and quotes section</li><li>categories (Programming, Philosophy/Psychology, Books, Music, Skateboarding, Writing stats.)</li><li>to make every paragraph admin/public possible + segmented loading (mongoDB)</li><li>automate to correct spellings (maybe)</li><li>mobileUI/UX</li><li>fucking Routing (ExpressJS)</li><li>update to Angular 7</li><li>implement editor to write blogs on website itself</li></ul><h3>Town Center update (Angular 7)</h3><p><a href=\"http://shubhamswe.xyz\" target=\"_blank\">Town Center</a> is the website to showcase all my projects, competitive programming stats. I made this project to prove to myself that I can make a responsive web app without any CSS library. It came out fine but with a LOT of code mostly media queries but on resolutions such as 1440x900 and 1600x900 it doesn't look symmetrical and it's a shame that my web app is not even symmetrical. <a href=\"https://github.com/strcoder4007/theTownCenter\" target=\"_blank\">Github repo</a><br />Hence, I need:</p><ul><li>to rewrite the whole css using Bootstrap or Bulma (using library is better for future maintenance)</li><li>more transparency</li><li>update to Angular 7</li></ul><h3>Project#19: Creek (Apollo + GraphQL)</h3><p>I left this project last year because I was using REST APIs and first making calls for enumerating favorite artists then again making calls for each of their albums and then sorting chronologically to see if any new album has been released. This was costing me around 20 seconds for making all the calls. Rendering the app totally unusable. Hopefully, I'll find a way out of this by using GraphQL or using some other api source altogether. I made it in Angular 5, if it comes down to making the app from scratch (which I'm hoping) I'll use React this time otherwise still I'll update it to Angular 7. <a href=\"https://github.com/strcoder4007/creek\" target=\"_blank\">Github repo</a></p>",

    "content": "<p><em>As the clock struck</em> <em>mid-night</em> I was sitting snuggled deep into my blanket in an upright position in the corner of my room listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I came to know it was new year when I heard the celebration. I was feeling good, the feeling of new beginnings kept me in high spirits. I thought at last this could be my break from the surmounting guilt of lost passion, for this would be my year! I will get back to Competitive Programming and practice even harder than the second-half of 2015. I felt like making new year's resolutions, I usually didn't believe in new year's resolutions or any type of resolution, aim or expectation at all, because I had failed at them countless times before. But that night, as I said the forgiving sense of new beginnings had already swept me away, so I gave it another try. Needless to say, I failed miserably but that comes later, will talk about that another time.</p><p>Among other new year's resolution one resolution was to document my life better, I felt there were way too many memories to hold in my head. I kept forgetting them if I didn't think about them in a long time. This fact in actual seriousness is scientifically correct. I made a plan to document my life better, although not knowing how to do it. My music history was being documented by last.fm which was one of the most important among the things to be documented. Another important thing to be documented was memories in the form of stories. This blog serves that purpose. I've named it <em>Memory Sequences</em> which is a term taken from the video game franchise <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. I started making this website on 21st July 2017 and I've documented the making process through out the week. That makes those blogs the first blogs on the website. Although I will be posting memories before the inception of this website which makes these memories technically older than the first blogs on the website. I've decided to sort the blogs in chronological order. This blog will serve as the description of the purpose and origin of the website.</p><p>This website serves as a means to document my life better, therefore needless to say whatever content is posted on the website is meant to be read by <em>future me</em> and that means most of the gory details and secrets won't be excluded from the blogs. Although, I have made this open so anyone interested can read this. Now, the type of blogs I will be posting here; actually, it's pretty simple; I will be posting anything that is important to me or I'm grateful for, three things mainly &mdash; music, philosophical findings, and memories. Other topics include skateboarding, books, and computer science stuff.</p>",

Fell in love the moment I heard it. Althought in my experience the songs that I like in the first listen are the songs which seem to fade away quickly. </p><p>Anyways, I am using tinyMCE&nbsp;editor. It's nice because it's producing the final HTML in minified format. I just need a way to automate this process. I should look into the features of this editor. Maybe there's a way to convert the HTML into JSON&nbsp;somehow. That would be so easy for me then. Will have to write extra code for user layer for login, that would require me to study MongoDB. Well, let's see how this goes.</p><p>I got an idea, some implementation of adding notes to memories. Although it would require me to manually add them in data.json file which will be tiresome. We will see about that. I have decided to leave data.json to be my primary and quite frankly the only way to update/add memories. I just need to figure out AWS. It's so fucking confusing. I configured it to run blue/green deployment but my server where not stopping, even when I terminated them manually, new servers kept popping up!</p><p>And this is the reason why you should plan your project properly before starting it. I don't have continous integration or any server to put this project on or the final wireframe of the project. When they say that you should wireframe your project first, I hope they know that most probably there will be major changes to the project in the future. I should have wireframed properly eitherways. Now I need to shift everything from base component to a new component of itself such that I can summon it anywhere in the base component as a part of the it. And similarly make new components as a child of the base component. If I had thought about this earlier then it would have saved much of my time now. So, I guess wireframing is important even though you will have to change most of it in the end.</p>",

    "content": "<p>I want to write about the project as I don't have any strong feeling towards something or any other substancial thing to write about.I have been working on this project for 12 days now. I am happy with what I've built so far. Angular 4 is an awesome framework! It has made the webapp so modular and versatile that each component can co-exist with every other component and together they are forming different states which basically is one of the permutation states. The app seems to run fast and efficient as I don't have any additional modules and libraries lying around. Dead-code has been minimized although Angular 4's <em>tree-shaking</em> would <em>nail the coffin</em>. The aim was to be light-weight, there was no restrictions on the processing power or anything, I made it such, 'cause <em>why not</em>? Although according to <em>Chrome's</em> console the whole app takes 2.3 seconds to load, which is higher than expected. So, I tried running a new project generated via angular-cli and benchmark it. It was taking 1.6 seconds to load the complete seed project. According to that I guess my app is supposed to take 2.3 seconds. I think <em>Spotify</em> is delaying the app. I see the errors for every <em>Spotify</em> player embedded, in the console. Strangers on the Internet are saying that it's some <em>Google Chrome</em> SSL certificate permission termination error. The solution provided didn't worked.</p><p>The webapp is more or less completed, the only things left is the admin layer and search linking. I have found the solution as to how I can make this webapp public and at the same time use it the way I wanted. The idea is to add an admin layer such that all the memories with \"personal\" tag on them will only be shown to me. These personal memories will simply be excluded from the final public JSON object. I will code it tomorrow I guess. The next problem would be to rent a Virtual Private Server. I am afraid in using my Dad's card for paying on services which automatically charge you after your free subscription gets over. I am very lazy and careless at this. I need a company where it's paid monthly or completly free, although the later is hard to find. It just happened to me the other day, I rented a VPS from <em>Amazon</em> and it was fine and working, I even checked <em>blue/green deployment</em>, it all worked. After getting bored off playing with it, I went on to some other project. Four days later, I found, while I was messing with AWS I started four instances and all of them have been continuously running since. The free(which is $1) limit was 750hrs and I was doing 940hrs.</p><p>Tomorrow I definitely will score a server. I hope Digital Ocean has <em>Continuous Integration</em>. If I am able to deploy it and pipe it to Github, I can automate the process of updating the content on the website.</p>",

I am currently well-versed in Angular4 + Typescript and I have 3 more web apps to make using this framework which is good but I want to make apps using GoLang&nbsp;and Ionic Framework as well. I am thinking of giving ReactJs a run too. People are saying it's light-weight and easy to learn. It's going head-to-head against Angular4, it has to be good. But then I also want to explore&nbsp;C++'s development side by making a project. And if I'm doing C++ then I might as well make games. That would check another thing off the bucket-list. Although&nbsp;I want to get in machine learning too, I've never paid much attention to it in the past but it seems that's where the future's headed. That makes 5 completely(more or less) new domains to be learned by me in the next 9 months. It would feel overwhelming if I make a schedule to do all these projects. Schedules never work with me any ways. I'm not going to stress over completing all of these but right now I want to do something new and that's why I need to decide on something soon.</p><p>\"<em><strong>Hofstadter's Law:</strong> It always takes longer than you expect, <br />even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law</em>.\"&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Douglas Hofstadter</p><p>It is probable that I won't complete all of these in time so, I have decided to divide them on the basis of urgency of the projects a&nbsp;short-term goal and a long-term goal. Skills in short-term goal are those which I need for mediocre jobs most probably in a start-up, keeping myself on the forefront of technology will help here. For completing short-term goals I think I should continue doing web dev and try learning the obscure parts such as RxJs, ReactJs, make software I need to automate my life thus, encouraging my sloth behavior and eventually taking me to the next level of laziness. Similarly for long-term goal i.e aiming for a job in really good startup most probably abroad. Getting sponsored for a visa is getting harder, although it's relatively easier for developers. Some European countries have a special job skills which a migrant can have, fortunately, software engineering related skills are the ones most in demand. For these startups and companies, I will require having a wider knowledge in computer science. I come from an algorithm(C++) background so I can say a huge &amp; a fairly difficult part is already covered. Game development in C++ would teach me the other side of the language the Object Oriented Programming side. I need to learn machine learning as well. It seems really fun. Actually, I don't know shit about machine learning, I ain't got anything else to write about it other than that the projects are in a different dimension and I really want to try it. I think all this would enstate me as a programmer with fairly balanced knowledge in computer science. According to me and quote me on this, \"becoming a jack of all trades and master of none seems fruitful in software development.\"</p><p>I was of bored of programming so I decided to think and write about the technologies I should learn next. Making plans is so stupid but I still did it. Just like millions times before this plan will also fail, I will complete them if they stay fun otherwise I will give up, I'm not going to stress over them. Actually you can't call this a full-fledged plan. There's a deadline but I won't care much if I crossed it and I haven't even decided the order of the project. I just wanted to layout my interests and decide which one to do first.</p>",

    "content": "<p>This past week my writing has been to a minimum. I don't exactly know why. Is it because of the website? Because I am not comfortable enough with the security of my personal blogs? Or is it because writing on a keyboard hasn't yet made itself completely familiar to me? Most probably it's nothing, it was like this because I didn't make the personal filter and because of that storing the data was time-takingly painful. I am again headed to the place where I was headed back in May. The funny thing is that it made the <em>new me</em> (I know these words have a touch of naiveness and are filled with ego but I can't think of any replacement right now) scared for a moment. I think much more is going on than I know, psychologically speaking. Fuck this! I'm not gonna care if these logs are poorly written.</p><p>I should get in a habit of writing my thoughts down before they fly away, I tell you, some of them are amazingly profound that in some sense I know immediately that I won't reach this conclusion ever again in my life, this should be written right now and here! I think my behavior is changing to <em>Hunter S. Thompson's</em>. I am really interested to know more about him as I find him someone that has been to places only few have treaded to. Therefore he would have the answers to my questions. I thought I was done with questions and that's why it's really important to keep in mind that I gave up on trying, I didn't gave up on my interests. It's just a phase I guess, you know, the immitation you do when you are completely polarized by someone. Although I won't mind if I started living on his principles and acting the way he did. Actually that's what I want, this is the first time I've found a balance between programming and drugs. A balance which still needs improvement but a working one nonetheless. Living on Hunter S. Thompson's principles would actually make me better at my craft. He is one of the <em>interesting people</em> I will write about soon. I just realized the title of this blog is \"Life Update\" and I haven't written shit on it yet. Programming is going slow these days. I am not able to write enough code these days because this weed is making me such a sloth. I don't feel like programming because of it. Even the aim of the day is not a lucrative one&mdash;<em>fix the login layer and try to find a way to map tags to searched string</em>. I want something more interesting than this. Actually these objectives mark the end of the project. I guess what's going on is my ignorance towards <em>almost</em> completed jobs. I do this when the job is more or less completed (but still incomplete) to the point where it can be practically said that it's completed. There's a model which is up and running in all it's glory but the luxury features are pending. The problem with this is that I leave the job incomplete and when I need them in future to show or use it in another project, I will have to complete it, but by then the technology in which it's written would have already aged like a motherfucker and I won't have any choice other than setting the project aside. I don't care much if I set myself straight but I recommend I should, it will save a lot of time in the future. I should start something hard. Game programming I guess. I want to be sober now. I want my brain to function normally. I want to feel the high of making new shit, music and writing. I need to get out of this room more frequently. College could be an option, there's food too. Well, it's only 4hrs, it can be done.</p><p>I need to write about the whole giving up thing. After I gave up pretty much everything inside my head changed. I keep thinking about a topic to write about, a topic which I have already written in the notebooks. But, whatever's there in the notebook is pre-giving up. So most of the things I wrote are the things I don't believe in now. I guess I should exclude everything pre-giving up. But to think&mdash;\"not logging most of my mistakes could be a mistake\" is something I can't overlook. I guess I will be adding few older blogs here and there afterall!</p>",

I don't know most of the concepts this app would require. </p><img style=\"padding: 10px 0px\" src = 'https://hmu6bg.bn1301.livefilestore.com/y4mZOoLRylqNFJoe-4ilheJJltn-DXvicuOeM0irpTnZNyzDAEBO-i859v67wfxE3dPIW3rnmg2oy33RlrOGQMzbyqYDRv_Rejla0whrqoNI9Inw6Np4UDZYhUlW2-E_f70VqGm0ppo7kZ8MT8k6pE5_nknSUCyYe1yCyQJdxskc6lkf1Z_EozWwZDdfqIfiOg67rQ81Qim8F1Kz5WhzovvfQ?width=1024&height=765&cropmode=none' width='100%'><p>Well, I made Memory Sequence in angular 4 and typescript when not knowing shit about them. Making this one requires really good knowledge of the framework. I don't know if I will be able to complete it but I will try. </p><p>The webapp I'm using is doing it's job fine but I need way more features. I want to custom make the software for myself. Make it work exactly the way I want and when I want. Also this app doesn't feel my type, there's no surprise and the design is crappy. I won't feel complete freedom unless I use the things I wrote and can control. I am thinking of parsing artist data from last.fm rather than linking to last.fm's page. This would make it lengthy but better.</p><p>In a nutshell I just need to implement Google auth and then further figure out the api to implement drive methods, once able to receive from drive I need to make a player and search for how to play audio using typescript then I will have to make the directory in tree structure in the sidebar so that I can drag and drop the artist I want to play and btw I need to implement drag and drop too, once the player is running using the songs from google drive I need to implement last.fm apis and make pages for artists i.e content, inside content component 3 types of pages would open song list, artist info and last.fm stats for the artist and last but surely not the least, completely redesign the app for mobile because it needs to look completely different and auto-responsiveness won't work.</p><p>And if I want luxury features too, then add yet another paragraph like that.</p>",

    "content": "<p>So, you know the truth right? That everything is pointless, that we don't matter, that nothing anyone has ever done matters. And nothing lasts forever so, one day our race will perish and the universe would go on like nothing happened. Actually for universe our extinction literally won't matter. Humans have the tendency to romaticize themselves as important beings, that there's purpose to our lives, that we're born for a reason. Nobody is born for any fucking reason. Humans are the same as other animals and plants. It's just that we have a more developed (yet flawed) brain. We are all programmed by our culture to believe that every single child is important and special. The fact that everyone is important directly means nobody is important is completely oblivious to people, I don't know how. I am talking about the sense of self-importance. I said \"sense\" because it's so deeply entrenced in us that we might as well consider it a sense now. It creeps up on you when it's receptors get ego hurt. Just like any other animal or plant, we don't matter either, no matter how developed our brains are we are not fucking special. We got intelligence and through that technology, we can escape our demise, you say? Our species won't be able to answer the identity of the universe ever. We won't ever reach that far.</p><p>\"Eternal blackness beyond the stars<br>we think our wisdom won't get that far\" &mdash; <strong>Iron Maiden, If Eternity Should Fail</strong></p><p>I think I've figured why no one's addressing the elephant in the room and still looking for answers to our existence from souls and spirits. The very nature of human is figuring out the reason behind any cause. We always look for answers and try to figure out the reason, in each and everything. While the whole point of our existence doesn't have any reason other than that a meteorite hit the earth hence commencing evolution. We started fanticizing about souls and spirits and I guess that's how religion was born. Some clever dude figured out the emotional longings of human, the crave for closure and control and fed us lies, about god, that there is a greater being watching over us, that he cares about us, that we are all his children thus, exploiting our weakness, self-importance. This lie was gullable for humans. I guess that's why religion is so prominent, it makes each one of us feel special in the eye of god.<p>\"The pestilence of Jesus Christ<br>There never was a sacrifice<br>No man who hung the crucifix<br>Beware the call for purity<br>Infections their facility<br>I've made my choice, 666!\" &mdash; <strong>Slayer, Cult</strong></p>But humans still try to figure out the reason they were born for, their destiny, the grand plan universe had laid out for them. Nobody's finding that shit 'cause it doesn't exist. Humans search for answers while the sheer simplicity of the fact is that there's no explanation, and that drives them insane. It's because they are wired to search and successfully find complete logical answers to make them feel they're in control. That's why I think most people subconsiously neglect the truth and keep themselves seduced by the thing they call \"life\".</p><p>They seem stupid, right? Afterall, they are searching for something that's right in front of them. No, they are actually not stupid at all. Because you see, that's the point of existence, nothing matters! That's our contract with the universe. There's no good, bad, right, wrong, clever, stupid, lie or truth. It's all in our head, hence in our society. The thing we call life is a mere castle in the air, there's absolutely nothing, nothing at all, but us (animals), plants and rocks, whole lotta rocks. And in reality, in the eyes of the universe we are nothing different from those rocks. If the age of the universe was condensed into one year, recorded human history would fit within the very last seconds of 31 December. We are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8V_glRW1hA\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: gray\"><u><b>insignificant</b></u></a>.</p><img style=\"padding: 10px 0px\" src = 'https://miro.medium.com/max/1344/1*6MUyun4RqF_97NKD05Hj8g.jpeg' width='100%'><p>\"We were nothing... for a billion years before our time<br>And we will be... nothing more again, for an eternity yet to come\" &mdash; <strong>Woods of Ypres, Death is not an Exit</strong></p><p>So, how do I live? What should I do until the time I've to confront the final truth, death? According to my philosophy, do absolutely anything you want! Do the most insignificant of things, it would be the same as doing the most <em>significant</em> thing you could possibly do. Because you see, nothing matters. There's a sense of freedom you would feel if you understand the philosophy. Because this literally means that you are free! There's freedom associated in knowing that we are powerless against time and universe, we might as well spend our lives doing what we love no matter how insignificant. What I'm implying is do basket weaving, spend major portion of your day weaving, day after day or be a rocket engineer, work for NASA or SpaceX, contribute in making humans interplanetary. Your time is well spent on doing either of those things and both are actually equally significant, insignificant.</p>“Whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.” &mdash; <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong>",

    "content": "<p>I have started with a new project. I need a code downloader for downloading my codes from codeforces and uploading them to github automatically. I'm making this for Linux, Windows and Mac, therefore, I see some future use of this desktop app not only by me but for anyone who want to save their code locally on whichever platform they want. I am using Javascript, nodejs and electron framework for this. </p><p><u>Will build the app and post here simultaneously.</u> <a target=\"_blank\" href='https://github.com/strcoder4007/codeScrapper'><u>Github Repository</u></a></p><h4><u>Day#1</u></h4><p>Wireframing is done. All I need to do now is to learn how to make desktop apps using electron and make it.</p><p>I've been learning this framework for the past hour and have made a useless but working app, successfully running on my 64 bit Arch Linux.</p><p>A little more decisiveness goes a long way. I did the exact opposite. Added bootstrap and then decided to do something new, therefore, instead bootstrap I'm going to use Materialize CSS. It's new and built on top of Angular Material. I thought of using Angular Material 2 directly but it's too early to use that, even the documentation is not yet ready. I've setteled on Materialize CSS. I haven't yet read it's documentation.</p><p>I have to say, Electron is awesome, but it has yet to go far. Many things are just manual, which I think they can automate in future versions making development faster. Electron is pretty straight forward. It uses IPCrenderer (equivalent to @output/@input in Angular 4) for communication between windows (equivalent to components in Angular 4). Basically the communication is the same as in socket.io.</p><p>Went with frameless window for linux and windows. For mac it's native traffic color is used. I am liking Matirialize CSS, it's new and therefore it has an easy grid system and implementing something like blockquotes and truely responsive texts is already built-in. Also, it uses my favourite font&mdash;Roboto as default font. No more <code style=\"background-color: #111\">npm install --save roboto-fontface</code> haha!</p><h4><u>Day#2</u></h4><p>I'm confused with the way electron handles data flow, if it even does or not. Should I just use ReactJs? or Angular4? No, not angular, it will unnecessarily make this project bloated. There is a way in electron I guess, by using sections. The thing is, electron doesn't divide the application into components, like Angular or React. Therefore, without those frameworks implementing this seems hard. I need to add and remove several nodes from DOM at certain states, there seems no feature like this in electron. I will have to use Vanilla Javascript or one of those two.</p><p>Things have started to make sense now.</p><p>Linux version is working fine, windows version is facing issues and no idea about macos version because I'm broke, I got no money to buy a mac. Will have to find some online tool to check macos version.</p><p>Frontend is almost done. How electron handles Inter-process communications is now clear.</p><p>Frustrated, lost 2 hours of code. I packaged the application for windows (.exe setup). It was created in the root folder itself. I was committing the progress on github, forgot that setup files are also present in the root and skipping the setup files for uploading was not declared in .gitignore file. Therefore, it started to upload 70mb of those setup files. Then I cancelled it and declared it in .gitignore and committed again. Didn't work because git had already staged it. I messed up everything and long story short I lost my code. Now I will have to code it again. My mistake.</p><h4><u>Day#3</u></h4><p>Not going to work on this project today, maybe a little bit if I feel like. Today I need to practice algorithms. I need it for an interview couple of days from now.</p><h4><u>Day#4</u></h4><p>Frontend is complete. Had to re-write the lost code. API's are working therefore now I just need to learn how to authenticate using SPOJ's APIs and download the code. Downloading from Codeforces doesn't require me to authenticate.</p><h4><u>Day#5</u></h4><p>The interface is done. The API is working fine. Although, it will take a couple of seconds to download solutions of user with large problem count. I'm making GET requests to the API around 200,000 times whenever the download button is clicked. If anyone has more solutions than that then, my bad. The main code for requests and parsing the \"Accepted\" solutions was fairly small. Written in vanilla JS I was able to place this block of code in the main file itself which electron uses. </p><p>Anyways, the project is almost done. Took around 9 hours to complete without coding the luxury features. This application can be made a lot better but still, a working version is complete and I want to move on to another project.</p>",

    "title": "My contract with competitive programming",
    "content": "<p>As the number of fields in computer science endlessly seem to grow, it's my time to move on. Competitive programming was the first thing I picked up in college. It was recommended to me by my best friend, in 2nd semester. I was learning C from a textbook at that time. I still remember the day I was not able to understand what are test cases and how the program has to be run/submitted on SPOJ. Although, I seriously started with competitive programming 6 months  later. As I didn't had computer science in high school, I had to learn some languages first. I learned C, python and haskell (you can guess how much I know this now) my fresher year. Then came back to competitive programming.</p><p>I don't want to write about my journey here. In short, I practiced around 150 ad-hoc questions on hackerrank and mathematics questions on project euler. Then slowly I went further deep into competitive programming. Starting with codeforces certainly did mark that. Practiced the hardest I had ever on codeforces, more than 500 ad-hoc questions in the span of 4 months including 14 days holidays. How's that for implementation skill? Suddenly I am among the people who know stuff. Focused more on algotithms, learned all graph alorithms, practiced the SPOJ. Then learned more obsecure ones such as fenwick tree, matrix exponentiation and segment trees. Now I am among the good-ish programmers.</p><p>Then came the motivation shift. It was easy to quickly secure the first place in college leaderboard because no one before me took competitive programming seriously. Having the first place on the leaderboard everytime made everyone come after me. Obviously, having 1st place doesn't matter shit. It was the fun, I was after. I explained it to myself, comparing myself to my competitors is worthless. But I couldn't save myself from getting into that loop of hell. My motivation shifted, I no longer pursued fun, I pursued 1st rank. And everything came falling down. I just can't do anything I don't like. My practice became stagnant. Web development was different and new for me. Fast forward a year of constantly starting and leaving competitive programming and without making any progress. I gave up competitive programming. Moved on to web dev.</p><p>After not thinking about competitive programming for 4 months. I've started to feel the same way I used to in 2015. It's fun again. I've given up on trying. Now, I actually don't give a fuck. I can again pursue just fun in competitive programming. So, I've decided to move on to machine learning as I've made a resonable number of projects in web development. And as for competitive programming, I will do it whenever I feel like. I don't have a goal. Therefore, I don't have a strong motivation for improving. If I feel like, I will learn new algorithms as well. Total freedom.</p>",

    "content": "<p>As the name suggests, this is a hybrid app for both android and iOS using Ionic 3 framework. Ionic framework heavily depends on Angular framework and that's awesome for me. After installing cordova and ionic I went on to open package.json to see the versions of all the dependencies used. To my surprise Ionic 3 uses Angular 5! It was just released a month ago and they have a full support for Angular 5 already with all of it's modules updated to version 5. That was cool to see. Now I will have to learn the concepts introduced in Angular 5 as well.</p><p>The interface of this app will be simple for now because I will concentrate on implementing the backend features I have in my mind. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the obsecure but still useful features of a real time messaging app. The features I have in mind are as follows:<br><ul><li>Have a bot integration.</li><li>Send messages at a specific time set by you.</li><li>Bot to mimic as user. Auto pilot mode. Like sending \"yesterday's photos to a friend\" automatically when that friend asks.</li><li>Going private on click. Either of the user can ask the other to go private. In private mode messages will have constricted length and will get permanentally deleted after 5 seconds.</li></ul></p><p>These are the features I have in mind right now. I'm not sure if I will be able to implement the bot to mimic because there is not much data available for any particular user for the neural net to learn. I need large amount of structured data to train the neural net. Well, some features will be excluded and some will be included as I continue making the app. Will list all of them above.<br><u>Will build the app and log here simultaneously</u></p><h4><u>Day#1</u></h4><p>I've wireframed the app. It's very similar to your standard messaging app. Nothin fancy added there. The app created and <a target=\"_blank\" href='https://github.com/strcoder4007/ionic_messenger'><u>github repo</u></a> created.</p><p>Currently in the process of learning Ionic 3 Framework. Components in Angular is named simply Pages in Ionic. The design of the router is done keeping mobile in mind. Here the components/pages you add are stacked on top of other. Push and pop is done in order to navigate throug pages. Push and pop are available functions and the router is the same as stack of pages.</p><p>Started making the app. Started with coding a little frontend so that the backend can be tested later. The home page is done on the frontend part. No backend yet.</p><h4><u>Day#2</u></h4><p>populated the users with json placeholders. Placed the tab on top.</p><p>Made the chat page. Used AlertController and ActionSheetController for asking to go private and other options.</p><p>Tested for both android and iOS, both working fine.</p><p>I really like how data moves in Ionic. There are many ways for components/page to talk including the ones using Angular's service and eventemitters. Ionic has it's own way as well using navPrams. It's from the NavigationController, amazing!!! Angular should implement the same in their router module, that would make talking much easier.</p><p>Cleaned the app. Removed the dead code.</p><p>I just found out that I can test this app on my mobile in real-time and that too without any extra work. A duplicate server runs on the wifi network. That is such a brilliant idea. Mind = Blown.</p>",
